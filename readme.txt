The KYA plugin lets you better understand your audience, track engagement, perform comparison analysis, and keep readers engaged.

== Description ==

PLEASE NOTE: This is a new version of the 1.0.0 plugin and requires that you manually enter your private/public API keys. They can be found on getkya.com under Setup. And they are entered in Wordpress under Settings -> KYA

The KYA plugin lets you better understand your audience, track audience engagement on all of your content, perform comparison analysis, and keep your audience more engaged with personalized recommendations.

Here's some of the ways KYA can help you spend less time staring at numbers and more time creating great content for your audience:

*   Track and compare your content's performance by engagement.

*   See what type of content/topics are trending on your site.

*   Better understand your audience with legitimate demographics and audience interest profiles.

*   Proactively figure out what kind of content to create next.

*   Help you keep your audience more engaged with personalized content recommendations.

*   Access to engaged readers email addresses (opt-in) and a way to easily export them so you can build mailing lists/newsletters.

*   The KYA Score is a ranking (0 to 100) that shows you how well your site is doing in terms of engagement compared to other sites in our network.

*   The KYA WordPress plugin puts the dashboard right in your WordPress admin panel so you donâ€™t even have to visit our site to get insights.
